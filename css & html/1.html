		<p><font size="3">There are several benefits that can be taken from the mountain for the Earth and its inhabitants. One of the benefits of mountains is to protect the natural ecosystems on Earth.

The book 'Amazing !!! The Best Science Stories from the Koran 'explain, when rain drops down, the mountains are able to drain rain water through the cracks of the rocks. This can avoid floods and landslides.

There are several mountains that store the wealth of coal mines, gold, silver, iron, tin, and other valuables. In addition, many plants that only live on the mountain are useful for medicinal or other ingredients.

The rocks in the mountains can be used for building materials. Can also be made as a sculpture or family furniture.

The existence of a cave in the mountain also functions as a residence for mountain dwellers to avoid heat and rain. The mountain also protects the inhabitants who live at the foot of the mountain from the big winds that hit.

Another function is as a peg for the Earth so that the planet remains firm or does not shake. "And He planted mountains on the Earth so that the Earth did not shake with you, (and He created) rivers and roads so that you can be guided," said Surah An-Nahl Verse 15.</font></p>
